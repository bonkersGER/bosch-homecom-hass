# Installation instructions
## Bosch Home
Before installing the integration you need to install Bosch HomeCom Easy APP and configure your devices.

### Installation
The easiest way, if you are using HACS, is to install it through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/).
For manual installation, copy the bosch_homecom folder and all of its contents into your Home Assistant's custom_components folder. This folder is usually inside your /config folder. If you are running Hass.io, use SAMBA to copy the folder over. If you are running Home Assistant Supervised, the custom_components folder might be located at /usr/share/hassio/homeassistant. You may need to create the custom_components folder and then copy the bosch_homecom folder and all of its contents into it.

A dialog box will popup asking you to input your Bosch HomeCom Easy APP username and password.
